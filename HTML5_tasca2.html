<a name="#parf_1">p&aacute;rrafo1</a>

 <p >Constructed in the 1950s, Units 1 and 2 of the Heilbronn power station were 

 decommissioned in 1988, followed many years ago by the decommissioning of Unit 3 and 4, which had an output of 200 megawatts (MW) each.

Now, a walk through the control centre 

 for Units 1 and 2 is like taking a trip through the history of power station technology. The former control rooms are like a museum. This space has now become the temporary office for the ABB service engineers and project management team during the horizontal migration period.

In comparison, the control centre for Units 5 and 6, each with an output 

 of 125 MW, is ten years younger and recognizably more modern, and Unit 7, which generates over 800 MW, also has a more contemporary, digitalized control centre.

The ABB project manager leads a team of ten employees who have whipped the control technology of the identically constructed Units 5 and 6 into shape 

 in only five weeks: boiler protection, 

 turbine protection, turbine control. Both of these units are operated as back-up power stations – only used if the wind is too weak, if there is insufficient 

 sunshine or when fluctuations in the 

 electricity network threaten to be exces- sive for other reasons. Both units are considered ‘system-relevant’ and are routinely started up on a monthly basis to ensure their availability.

Time is money The 30-year-old control system of Units 5 and 6 was outdated. The ABB service team’s task was to refit it to the tried and tested, modular construction, migration-based ABB control system, Procontrol P14.

The entire migration including the commissioning has been completed within only three months. Today, considerably shorter timeframes are being expected by the plant operators as part of their regular plant shutdowns. This was the biggest challenge. In order to reduce 

 the downtimes of the plant, and in the interest of the customer, the ABB 

 service team worked over many weekends and bank holidays.

The ABB service concept for power generation customers is not only based on extensive process and application know-how, but predominantly also on the longstanding customer relationships and continuity in customer advice and care by the plant managers.

In the middle of 2015, the ageing existing systems of Units 5 and 6 were 

 migrated to the pre-tested control technology P14, which, it is envisaged, will be in service until 2030. It has been almost seamless since then, with the gradual modernization of power station 

control technology in Unit 7. The unit was completely equipped with the electrical system by ABB at the start 

 of the 1980s: turbines, generators, 

 Procontrol P14 control technology and 

 everything related to this system. 

 However, over the years, the measure- ment accuracy has gradually decreased. That is why EnBW, with ABB, has gra- dually been replacing all switching cabi- nets since 2012 – ABB has refitted 

 approximately one-fifth of the cabinets 

 in this time. With the harmonization 

 and modernization of Units 5, 6 and 7, EnBW is simultaneously obtaining a 

 joint operating and observation system 

 for all three units. At the start of this year, the draught regulation for both units was also migrated.

Like the back of their hand This was a fundamental criterion for 

 the energy group in finally awarding the contract. ABB was not necessarily 

 the ‘preferred supplier’, despite the long- standing customer relationship.

The phased control technology modernization works are ongoing, and the 

 respective inspection times of the turbines set the pace. In order to continue to be on the safe side in future, EnBW has extended its existing service contract across all three units.</p>

<a name="#parf_2">p&aacute;rrafo2</a>

<p >In this edition we would like to inform you about new functionalities of the P14 family. Since our last newsletter we have optimized our product range, exchanging a number of devices with a more highly developed product version.

After we announced our new Universal Input Module 81EU50R1210 in the last P14 news we are proud to introduce our new remote bus coupling module 88TK60R1210 within the bulletin at hand. Therewith we continue our streamlining strategy which will result in a minimum multifunctional devices sufficient to maintain the complete power plant. 

The remote bus coupling module 88TK60R1210 is used to couple the Pro

control station to the Procontrol remote bus which uses the High-availability Seamless Redundancy (HSR) protocol. HSR protocol is a standard Ethernet (IEEE 802.3) redundancy protocol. The module is equipped with up to date components and fully 

 replaces the predecessor modules.

We furthermore want to inform you about the successful upgrade of the P14 control system of the power plant Heilbronn, Germany, as well as the Power Generation Care contract – an evolved, cooperative concept focused on customer requirements. In this way, the ABB solution enables you as the customer to benefit from savings effects without reduction in performance, while protecting your previous and future investments.

Also I would like to announce Dominik Eifel as the new P14 Evolution Manager. He will take over the position after my retirement at the end of this year.

Your local representative and I welcome any questions or comments you may have reading our newsletter.

I wish you a pleasant read and look forward to your feedback. 

With kind regards, Günter Herz Procontrol P14 Evolution Manager  ABB Power Generation

    Procontrol P14 is a complete power plant control system with a simple and flexible architecture that enables customers all over the world to meet the diverse operating and business needs of their markets. </p>

 Human Interface Station (HIS)

An HIS serves as a human interface for operation,

monitoring, and engineering.  Software packages installed

in a general-purpose personal computer (an IBM PC/AT

compatible computer, hereinafter referred to as a general-

purpose PC) or in a console HIS, consisting of a general-

purpose PC and Open Display Style Console Assembly,

implement operation and monitoring functions as well as

engineering functions.

Users can install and run operation and monitoring

functions and/or engineering functions in an HIS as

necessary. For connections to the Vnet/IP, a VI701 Control

Bus Interface Card is used. For HIS hardware specifica-

tions, see publications GS 33Q06B40-31E and GS

33Q06B50-31E for Human Interface Stations and GS

33Q02C10-31E for Standard Operation and Monitoring

Function.

ld Control Station (FCS)

The FCS performs process control and manages commu-

nications with subsystems such as PLCs.  Two types of

field control stations for Vnet/IP and FIO are available:

AFV10S: Field Control Unit (for Vnet/IP, FIO, rack-

mounted)

AFV10D: Duplexed Field Control Unit (for Vnet/IP,

FIO, rack-mounted)

For FCS hardware specifications, see publication GS

33P06C10-31E.

? Advanced Process Control Station (APCS)

An APCS advanced process control station implements

control functions with a general-purpose PC connected to

a Vnet/IP, aimed at improving advanced control and plant

efficiency. For this purpose, install LFS1200 APCS control

functions. Use VI701 Control Bus Interface Card for

connection to Vnet/IP. For more details, see APCS Control

Functions General Specifications (publication GS

33Q03M10-31E).

? Generic Subsystem Gateway Package

(GSGW)

With a general-purpose PC connected to a Vnet/IP,

GSGW packages can collect and set data of various types

of subsystems using an OPC DA server. They can easily

collect and set subsystem data without creating dedicated

communications programs.

Install LFS1250 Generic Subsystem Gateway Package.

Use VI701 Control Bus Interface Card for connections to

Vnet/IP. For more details, see publication GS 33Q03P10</p>

			<p>Power Generation Care is a complete ser- vice offering that raises the performance of the plant’s automation and electrical assets, its operations and maintenance staff, and the production process during the life cycle of the facility.

It is designed to meet the service requirements of ABB customers worldwide, 

 whether they are a publicly or investorowned utility or independent power producer, or whether they operate a single plant or a fleet of plants in one or more countries or regions.

Despite their differences and the varying opportunities in the markets they operate in, power generation companies the world over share three things in common with regard to their service requirements: - Their plants require maintenance  on a day-to-day basis to maximize plant availability and reliability and minimize the possibility of disruptions to production; - They want to extract more value from their existing assets by extending the lifetime of the plant by an additional 5, 10, 15 or 30 years and be certain that the plant will continue to perform optimally throughout that extended lifespan; and - They want to optimize the performance of the plant as a whole. This may include improving the production of steam or reducing the consumption of energy or enhancing the knowledge and skills of the workforce throughout their years at the  plant.

Power Generation Care is ABB’s response to these customer requirements.

Continuous collaboration Partnership, life-cycle management and stepwise evolution of the plant’s distributed control system are the defining 

 principles of Power Generation Care.

Partnership and continuous collaboration between ABB and the customer is key. For its part, ABB contributes deep 

 expertise in automation and electrical 

 technologies and the power generation process: - We are ranked by ARC Advisory Group as the global market leader in distributed control systems, both for the sector as a whole and for critical infrastructure industries like power generation, oil and gas, mining and pulp and paper; - We are acknowledged by the market as the leader in the power technologies that make up the electrical balance of plant – transformers, generator circuit breakers, motors and drives, and so on; and - We have vast expertise in power  generation processes, based on more than 125 years in the industry.

 

Plant strategies This expertise is on hand to meet each customer’s specific requirements and busi- ness targets, in particular: their asset strategy for the plant in question, which is usually based on the number of years the plant has left to run; the operating strategy of the plant, whether it runs at 

 

base load, peaking load or load-following; and the operations and maintenance 

 culture of the plant or company.

For instance, a plant that has 25 more years of scheduled running time requires a different maintenance strategy than one scheduled for closure within the next few years. The former will require a long-term DCS service program with planned upgrades that evolve the system stepwise over time; whereas the latter may get by with refurbished parts rather than new ones. Similarly, a plant that is running 

 at maximum output around the clock 

 requires a different service approach than one that is ramping up and down several times a day to provide power at peak demand.

And the operations and maintenance culture of a company may differ from one plant to another depending on the skill level of the operators and service engi- neers. Typically, 80% of the DCS is not used to its full potential. Learning programs can equip staff with the knowledge to use the system to its full potential. This is becoming ever more crucial as we enter the era of big data and the Internet of Things, Services and People, at the heart of which is the plant’s DCS</p>

<P>It is essential that you take the greatest of care when setting up the user interface. All objects created in the  are displayed on the screen in the user’s office. The pictures created are the only interface between the machine and the user. For this reason, you must take great care creating them since they play an important role in ensuring the success of a project. It goes without saying that operation of the plant is more important than the appearance of the screen but in the long term sloppily created pictures can mar the impression made by and possibly even increase the costs 

In a screen display system, information about the current status of the plant is presented to the users solely by means of the pictures displayed. This interface must, therefore, provide . WinCC allows you to configure the user interface precisely as you want it. How you lay out the user interface of your own particular system depends on the hardware you use, on the demands during processing and on specifications that already exist.

When you are configuring the user interface, you must make the users, for whom configuration is after all being performed, the focus of your contemplations.

If you succeed in giving the users the information they need and do so in a clear manner, the result will be a . The amount of maintenance work necessary will also be reduced.

The users need as must information as they can get. Using this data as the foundation, the users can take the decisions that are essential to keeping the process running and with a high level of quality. The main job of the users is not to respond to alarms (the process has then already been thrown off balance), but to use their experience, knowledge of the process and the information provided by the operating system to predict the direction in which the process is developing. The users should be able to counteract irregularities before they arise. WinCC gives you the ability to edit and display this information to the users effectively.

When displaying analog values, combine them with pointer instruments with digital values. Graphical representation of values (e.g. pointer instruments, bar graphs ...) makes it far easier and quicker for users to identify and grasp information. In order to avoid problems from arising in the unlikely but possible event of a user being color-blind, important changes to an object (state) should be indicated by using not only a different color but also a different format. Important information must always be immediately recognizable as such in a picture. This means good use of contrasting colors is essential.

The following specifications apply to updating in the projects dealt with in this manual: Insofar as the task definition permits, updating is performed driven by events. Since we work predominantly with , we often trigger change of the tags. When using external tags, this can lead to increased system load depending on the process driver connection. If communication allows event-driven transfer, it has to be chosen for timecritical data. Non-critical data can then be fetched by the HMI in suitable cycles (polling procedure).

Totally Integrated Automation is optimized for all requirements and is open for international standards and third-party systems. With its six characteristic system characteristics (engineering, communications, diagnostics, safety, security, and ruggedness), Totally Integrated Automation supports the complete lifecycle of a machine or plant. The complete system architecture offers holistic solutions for every automation segment on the basis of a comprehensive range of products.

SIMATIC: more efficient and systematic automation

SIMATIC, a core part of Totally Integrated Automation, comprises a variety of standardized, flexible, and scalable products – such as the products for process visualization with SIMATIC WinCC presented in this brochure.

SIMATIC is currently considered to be the global number one in automation. One of the decisive reasons for this is that SIMATIC exhibits the six system characteristics of Totally Integrated Automation: • Engineering • Communication • Diagnostics • Safety • Security • Ruggedness

In addition, SIMATIC offers two additional system characteristics: • Technology • Fault tolerance

For more information on the system characteristics and the resulting advantages, see the following chapter "System characteristics".

Maximum engineering efficiency – in all phases of the lifecycle of the machine and plant With SIMATIC you rely on an integrated engineering environment. Efficient software supports you over the complete lifecycle of your machine or plant – from the planning and design stages through configuring and programming as far as commissioning, operation and upgrading. With its integration capability and harmonized interfaces, SIMATIC software supports a high degree of data consistency – throughout the entire engineering process. Siemens has redefined engineering with its Totally Integrated Automation Portal (TIA Portal). The new TIA Portal engineering framework combines the SIMATIC STEP 7, SIMATIC WinCC and SINAMICS StartDrive automation software tools in a unique development environment.

SIMATIC WinCC is a scalable process visualization system with powerful functions for monitoring automated processes. WinCC provides complete SCADA functionality under Windows for all sectors – from single-user to distributed multi-user systems with redundant servers and crosslocation solutions with web clients.

WinCC system software

The WinCC system software is available in two basic variants:

• WinCC complete package (RC: license for runtime and configuring) • WinCC runtime package (RT: runtime license) Both packages are available with 128, 512, 2k, 8k, 64k, 100k, 150k or 256k PowerTags. 

Only process tags that are connected to the controller or other data sources via a WinCC communication channel are designated as PowerTags. Up to 32 messages and up to 256 userdefinable analog alarms can be derived from one process tag. Moreover, internal tags without process connection are available for free to provide additional system performance. 

PowerPacks allow an increase in the number of usable PowerTags. Thus, WinCC also grows when your application grows. You can start with the smallest variant and then upgrade as needed with attractive PowerPacks.

With PowerPacks, the number of available archive tags can also be increased, from 512 (contained in the basic scope) by 1,500, 5,000, 10,000, 30,000 or 80,000 to up to 120,000.

WinCC Comprehensive Support 

WinCC provides a Software Update Service (SUS) via Comprehensive Support in the form of an extensive support package which contains current updates as well as a lot of useful information and software for WinCC.

Automatic distribution of current upgrades and service packs for WinCC ensures that the latest WinCC version is always available to you.

Packages with WinCC runtime software 

The SIMATIC Panel PC packages with WinCC are optimally harmonized combinations of HMI hardware and software.
